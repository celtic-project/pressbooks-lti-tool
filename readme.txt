This plugin allows Pressbooks to be integrated with on-line courses using the 1EdTech Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) specification.

== Description ==
The LTI specifications from [1EdTech](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability) provide a seamless and secure mechanism for making connections between a platform (such as an VLE/LMS) and a tool (such as a textbook on a publisher's site or a quiz engine).  This plugin enables a Pressbooks installation of WordPress to be accessed as an LTI Tool.  It is built as an extension of the [LTI Tool plugin](http://www.spvsoftwareproducts.com/php/wordpress-lti/).

This plugin was developed with the financial support of [Delivros Orell Füssli, Switzerland](https://delivros-orellfuessli.ch/).

See [installation](https://github.com/celtic-project/pressbooks-lti-tool/wiki/Installation/).

== Changelog ==
